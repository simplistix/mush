How Mush works
==============

.. currentmodule:: mush

.. note:: 

  This documentation explains how Mush works using fairly abstract
  examples. If you'd prefer more "real world" examples please see the
  :doc:`examples` documentation.

.. _constructing-runners:

Constructing runners
--------------------

Mush works by assembling a number of callables into a :class:`Runner`:

.. code-block:: python

  from mush import Runner

  def func1():
      print('func1')

  def func2():
      print('func2')

  runner = Runner(func1, func2)

Once assembled, a runner can be called any number of times. Each time
it is called, it will call each of its callables in turn:

>>> runner()
func1
func2

More callables can be added to a runner:

.. code-block:: python

 def func3():
     print('func3')

 runner.add(func3)

If you want to add several callables in one go, you can use the
runner's :meth:`~Runner.extend` method:

.. code-block:: python

 def func4():
     print('func4')

 def func5():
     print('func5')

 runner.extend(func4, func5)

Now, when called, the runner will call all five functions:

>>> runner()
func1
func2
func3
func4
func5

Runners can also be added together to create a new runner:

.. code-block:: python

  runner1 = Runner(func1)
  runner2 = Runner(func2)
  runner3 = runner1 + runner2

This addition does not modify the existing runners, but does give the
result you'd expect:

>>> runner1()
func1
>>> runner2()
func2
>>> runner3()
func1
func2

This can also be done by passing runners in when creating a new runner
or calling the extend method on a runner, for example:

.. code-block:: python

  runner1 = Runner(func1)
  runner2 = Runner(func2)
  runner4_1 = Runner(runner1, runner2)
  runner4_2 = Runner()
  runner4_2.extend(runner1, runner2)

In both cases, the results are as you would expect:

>>> runner4_1()
func1
func2
>>> runner4_2()
func1
func2


Finally, runners can be cloned, providing a way to encapsulate commonly
used base runners that can then be extended for each specific use case:

.. code-block:: python

  runner5 = runner3.clone()
  runner5.add(func4)

The existing runner is not modified, while the new runner behaves as
expected:

>>> runner3()
func1
func2
>>> runner5()
func1
func2
func4

.. _configuring-resources:

Configuring Resources
---------------------
Where Mush becomes useful is when the callables in a runner either
produce or require objects of a certain type. Given the right
configuration, Mush will wire these together enabling you to write
easily testable and reusable callables that encapsulate specific
pieces of functionality. This configuration is done either
imperatively, declaratively or using a combination of the two styles
as described in the sections below.

For the examples, we'll assume we have three types of resources:

.. code-block:: python

  class Apple: 
      def __str__(self):
          return 'an apple'
      __repr__ = __str__

  class Orange: 
      def __str__(self):
          return 'an orange'
      __repr__ = __str__

  class Juice:
      def __str__(self):
          return 'a refreshing fruit beverage' 
      __repr__ = __str__

Imperative configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Imperative configuration requires no decorators and is great when
working with callables that come from another package or the standard
library:

.. code-block:: python

 def apple_tree():
      print('I made an apple')
      return Apple()

 def magician(fruit):
      print('I turned {0} into an orange'.format(fruit))
      return Orange()

 def juicer(fruit1, fruit2):
      print('I made juice out of {0} and {1}'.format(fruit1, fruit2))

The requirements are passed to the :meth:`~Runner.add`
method of a runner which can express requirements for both arguments
and keyword parameters:

.. code-block:: python

  runner = Runner()
  runner.add(apple_tree)
  runner.add(magician, Apple)
  runner.add(juicer, fruit1=Apple, fruit2=Orange)

Calling this runner will now manage the resources, collecting them and
passing them in as configured:

>>> runner()
I made an apple
I turned an apple into an orange
I made juice out of an apple and an orange

Declarative configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is done using the :func:`requires` decorator to mark the
callables with their requirements, which can specify the types
required for either arguments or keyword parameters:

.. code-block:: python

  from mush import requires

  def apple_tree():
      print('I made an apple')
      return Apple()

  @requires(Apple)
  def magician(fruit):
      print('I turned {0} into an orange'.format(fruit))
      return Orange()

  @requires(fruit1=Apple, fruit2=Orange)
  def juicer(fruit1, fruit2):
      print('I made juice out of {0} and {1}'.format(fruit1, fruit2))
      return Juice()

These can now be combined into a runner and executed. The runner will
extract the requirements stored by the decorator and will use them to
map the parameters as appropriate:

>>> runner = Runner(apple_tree, magician, juicer)
>>> runner()
I made an apple
I turned an apple into an orange
I made juice out of an apple and an orange

Hybrid configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The two styles of configuration are entirely interchangeable, with
declarative requirements being inspected whenever a callable is added
to a runner, and imperative requirements being taken whenever they are
passed via the :meth:`~Runner.add` method:

.. code-block:: python

  @requires(Juice)
  def packager(juice):
      print('I put {0} in a bottle'.format(juice))
  
  def orange_tree():
      print('I made an orange')
      return Orange()

  trees = Runner(apple_tree, orange_tree)
  runner = trees.clone()
  runner.extend(juicer, packager)
  
This runner now ends up with bottled juice:

>>> runner()
I made an apple
I made an orange
I made juice out of an apple and an orange
I put a refreshing fruit beverage in a bottle

It's useful to note that imperative configuration will be used in
preference to declarative configuration where both are present:

.. code-block:: python

  runner = trees.clone()
  runner.add(juicer, Orange, Apple)

This runner will give us juice made in a different order:

>>> runner()
I made an apple
I made an orange
I made juice out of an orange and an apple
 
.. _usage-periods:

Resource usage periods
----------------------

It can be important for a callable to have either first access or last
access to a particular resource. For this reason, configuration can
specify one of three periods during which a callable needs to be
called with a particular resource; the default is `normal` and a
decorator can be used to indicate either `first` or `last`. Within
these periods, callables are called in the order they are added to the
runner.

As an example, consider a ring and some things that can be done to it:

.. code-block:: python

  class Ring:
      def __str__(self):
          return 'a ring'

  def forge():
      return Ring()

  def polish(ring):
      print('polishing {0}'.format(ring))

  def more_polish(ring):
      print('polishing {0} again'.format(ring))

  def engrave(ring):
      print('engraving {0}'.format(ring))

  def package(ring):
      print('packaging {0}'.format(ring))

These can now be added to a runner with configuration expressing the
correct periods:

.. code-block:: python

  from mush import Runner, first, last

  runner = Runner(forge)
  runner.add(package, last(Ring))
  runner.add(polish, first(Ring))
  runner.add(more_polish, first(Ring))
  runner.add(engrave, Ring)

Even though the callables were added out order, they will be executed
correctly:

>>> runner()
polishing a ring
polishing a ring again
engraving a ring
packaging a ring

The configuration of periods works identically with both the imperative
and declarative forms.

Waiting for a resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes, a callable needs to wait for some other callable to do its
work but does not need or cannot accept objects of the type returned
by that callable. For example, and miss-using the fruit types from above:

.. code-block:: python

  def func1():
      return Apple()

  def func2(apple):
      print('func2 got {0}'.format(apple))
      return Orange()

  def func3(apple):
      print('func3 got {0}'.format(apple))

  def func4(orange):
      print('func4 processed {0}'.format(orange))

If we want :func:`func3` only to get called once :func:`func4` has
processed the :class:`Orange` but, for reasons of abstraction, 
we want to add the callables in the order defined above, the simplest
runner will not give us what we want:

>>> runner = Runner(func1)
>>> runner.add(func2, Apple)
>>> runner.add(func3, Apple)
>>> runner.add(func4, Orange)
>>> runner()
func2 got an apple
func3 got an apple
func4 processed an orange

The problem is that the runner hasn't been told that :func:`func3`
has a dependency on :class:`Orange`. This can be done using the
:func:`after` type wrapper to specify that :func:`func2` requires an
:class:`Orange` to exist, and for any other callables added to the
runner that need an :class:`Orange` to have been called first, but
that it must not be passed that orange:

.. code-block:: python

  from mush import Runner, after

  runner = Runner(func1)
  runner.add(func2, Apple)
  runner.add(func3, after(Orange), Apple)
  runner.add(func4, Orange)

Now, even though we've added the callables in the order we want, we
get the order of calling that we need:

>>> runner()
func2 got an apple
func4 processed an orange
func3 got an apple

Special return types
---------------------

There are certain types that can be returned from a callable that have
special meaning. While these are provided in case of their specific
need, you should think twice when you find yourself wanting to use
them as it is often a sign that your code can be better structured
differently.

For the examples below, we'll use the fruit classes from above.

Returning multiple resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A callable can return multiple resources by returning either a list or
a tuple:


.. code-block:: python

  def orchard():
      return Apple(), Orange()

This can be used to provide both types of fruit:

>>> runner = Runner(orchard, juicer)
>>> runner()
I made juice out of an apple and an orange

Overriding the type of a resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you may need to force a returned resource to be of a
particular type. When this is the case, a callable can return a
dictionary mapping the forced type to the required type:

.. code-block:: python

  class Pear: 
      def __str__(self):
          return 'a pear'

  def desperation():
      print('oh well, a pear will have to do')
      return {Apple: Pear()}

We can now make juice even though we don't have apples:

>>> runner = Runner(orange_tree, desperation, juicer)
>>> runner()
I made an orange
oh well, a pear will have to do
I made juice out of a pear and an orange

Returning marker types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some circumstances, you may need to ensure that some callables are
used only after another callable has done its work, even though that
work does not return a resource.
This can be achieved using a marker type that is mapped to :obj:`nothing`
when it is returned:

.. code-block:: python

  from mush import nothing

  class SetupComplete: pass

  def setup():
      print('setting things up')
      return {SetupComplete: nothing}

  @requires(SetupComplete)
  def body():
      print('doing stuff')

Note that the :func:`body` callable does not take any arguments or
parameters; because :func:`setup` maps the :class:`SetupComplete` type
to :obj:`nothing`, it is not passed to any callables that require it
and it is used purely to affect the order of calling:

>>> runner = Runner(body, setup)
>>> runner()
setting things up
doing stuff

.. _resource-parts:

Using parts of a resource
-------------------------

When pieces of functionality use settings provided either by command
line arguments or from configuration files, it's often cleaner to
structure that code to recieve the specific setting value rather than
the setting's container. It's certainly easier to test. Mush can take
care of the needed wiring when configured to do so using the
:class:`attr` and :class:`item` helpers:

.. code-block:: python

    from mush import Runner, attr, item, requires

    class Config(dict): pass

    class Args(object):
        fruit = 'apple'

    def parse_args():
        return Args()

    def read_config():
        return Config(fruit='orange')

    @requires(attr(Args, 'fruit'), item(Config, 'fruit'))
    def pick(fruit1, fruit2):
        print('I picked {0} and {1}'.format(fruit1, fruit2))
        picked = []
        for fruit in fruit1, fruit2:
            if fruit=='apple':
                picked.append(Apple())
            elif fruit=='orange':
                picked.append(Orange())
            else:
                raise TypeError('You have made a poor fruit choice')
        return picked

While the :func:`pick` function remains usable and testable on its
own:

>>> pick('apple', 'orange')
I picked apple and orange
[an apple, an orange]

It can also be added to a runner with the other necessary functions
and Mush will do the hard work:

>>> runner = Runner(parse_args, read_config, pick, juicer)
>>> runner()
I picked apple and orange
I made juice out of an apple and an orange

.. _context-managers:

Context manager resources
-------------------------

A frequent requirement when writing scripts is to make sure that
when unexpected things happen they are logged, transactions are
aborted, and other necessary cleanup is done. Mush supports this
pattern by allowing context managers to be added as callables:

.. code-block:: python

    from mush import Runner, requires

    class Transactions(object):

        def __enter__(self):
            print('starting transaction')

        def __exit__(self, type, obj, tb):
            if type:
                print(obj)
                print('aborting transaction')
            else:
                print('committing transaction')
            return True

    def a_func():
        print('doing my thing')

    def good_func():
        print('I have done my thing')

    def bad_func():
        raise Exception("I don't want to do my thing")

The context manager is wrapped around all callables that are called
after it:

>>> runner = Runner(Transactions, a_func, good_func)
>>> runner()
starting transaction
doing my thing
I have done my thing
committing transaction

This gives it a chance to clear up when things go wrong:

>>> runner = Runner(Transactions, a_func, bad_func)
>>> runner()
starting transaction
doing my thing
I don't want to do my thing
aborting transaction

.. _debugging-runners:

Debugging
---------

Mush makes some heuristic decisions about the order in which to call
objects added to a runner. If your expectations of the call order
don't match that used by Mush, it can be confusing to figure out where
the difference comes from.

For this reason, when constructing a :class:`Runner` you can pass an
optional debug parameter which can be either a boolean ``True`` or a
file-like object. If passed, debug information will be generated
whenever an object is added to the runner.

If ``True``, this information will be written to
:obj:`~sys.stderr`. If a file-like object is passed instead, the
information will be written to that object.

As an example, consider this code:

.. code-block:: python

    from mush import Runner, requires
    
    class T1(object): pass
    class T2(object): pass
    class T3(object): pass
    
    def makes_t1():
        return T1()
    
    @requires(T1)
    def makes_t2(obj):
        return T2()
    
    @requires(T2)
    def makes_t3(obj): 
        return T3()
    
    @requires(T3, T1)
    def user(obj1, obj2):
        m.user(type(obj1), type(obj2))
   
The debug information that would be written looks like this:

>>> import sys
>>> runner = Runner(makes_t1, makes_t2, makes_t3, user, debug=sys.stdout)
Added <function makes_t1 ...> to 'normal' period for <... 'NoneType'> with Requirements()
Current call order:
For <... 'NoneType'>:
  normal: <function makes_t1 ...> requires Requirements()
<BLANKLINE>
Added <function makes_t2 ...> to 'normal' period for <class 'T1'> with Requirements(T1)
Current call order:
For <... 'NoneType'>:
  normal: <function makes_t1 ...> requires Requirements()
For <class 'T1'>:
  normal: <function makes_t2 ...> requires Requirements(T1)
<BLANKLINE>
Added <function makes_t3 ...> to 'normal' period for <class 'T2'> with Requirements(T2)
Current call order:
For <... 'NoneType'>:
  normal: <function makes_t1 ...> requires Requirements()
For <class 'T1'>:
  normal: <function makes_t2 ...> requires Requirements(T1)
For <class 'T2'>:
  normal: <function makes_t3 ...> requires Requirements(T2)
<BLANKLINE>
Added <function user ...> to 'normal' period for <class 'T3'> with Requirements(T3, T1)
Current call order:
For <... 'NoneType'>:
  normal: <function makes_t1 ...> requires Requirements()
For <class 'T1'>:
  normal: <function makes_t2 ...> requires Requirements(T1)
For <class 'T2'>:
  normal: <function makes_t3 ...> requires Requirements(T2)
For <class 'T3'>:
  normal: <function user ...> requires Requirements(T3, T1)
<BLANKLINE>
