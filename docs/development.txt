Once that has been done and you have a checkout, you can follow these
instructions to perform various development tasks:

Setting up a virtualenv
-----------------------

The recommended way to set up a development environment is to turn
your checkout into a virtualenv and then install the package in
editable form as follows::

  $ virtualenv .
  $ bin/pip install -U -e .[test,build]

Running the tests
-----------------

Once you have a buildout, the tests can be run as follows::

  $ bin/nosetests

Building the documentation
--------------------------

The Sphinx documentation is built by doing the following from the
directory containg setup.py::

  $ cd docs
  $ make html

Making a release
----------------

To make a release, just update the version in ``setup.py``,
update the change log, tag it
and push to https://github.com/Simplistix/mush
and Travis CI should take care of the rest.

Once Travis CI is done, make sure to go to
https://readthedocs.org/projects/mush/versions/
and make sure the new release is marked as an Active Version.
